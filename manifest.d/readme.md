This is a collection of scripts I have made to
assist the usage of the windowmanager known as [i3wm]. 

# examples

Execute a script with the `--help` flag to display help about the command. 

`i3get --help` display [i3get] help  
`i3get --version` display [i3get] version  
`man i3get` show [i3get] man page    
`i3ass` show version info for all scripts and dependencies.

# readme_install

If you are using **Arch linux**, you can install the i3ass package from [AUR].  

Or follow the instructions below to install from source:  

(*configure the installation destination in the Makefile, if needed*)

``` text
$ git clone https://github.com/budlabs/i3ass.git
$ cd i3ass
# make install
$ i3ass
i3ass - version: 0.002

gawk      [INSTALLED]
sed       [INSTALLED]

All the scripts that will be installed are located in the `src` directory of this repo, so you can also just add that directory or the scripts to your **$PATH**.  

# readme_issues

`i3-msg restart` breaks [i3fyra], try to use `i3-msg reload` instead (*it's faster and usually works just as good as restart*).
